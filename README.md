## Personal website description

This is my personal website which I'm currently working on. 

It will include personal information, experience and some project that I've done, all on the same website for easy accessibility. 

The stack I'm using is Next.js, Typescript and styled-components.

Feel free to look through the code and suggest changes, I'm open to learn new ways of working and expand my skillset. 

Enjoy!
