## Personal website description

This is my personal website which I'm currently working on. 

It will include personal information, experience and some project that I've done, all on the same website for easy accessibility. 

The stack I'm curerntly using is Next.js, Typescript and styled-components. Currently new to this stack, aiming to learn new front-end technologies. 

After I finish the basic content I'll look into moving some parts on the backend and get experience in that area. 

Feel free to look through the code and suggest changes, I'm open to learn new ways of working and expand my skillset. 

Enjoy!
